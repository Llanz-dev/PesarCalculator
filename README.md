# PesarCalculator

## Description
PesarCalculator is a BMI calculator to determine if you're underweight, normal or overweight. There are 3 height metrics to choose from. Meter, inches, and feet.

- It will calculate your BMI result depending on your height and weight.
- I use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make this project.

## How to Run the Project
Just clone this and open the **bmiCalculator.html**.
